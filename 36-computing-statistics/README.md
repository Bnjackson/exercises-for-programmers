Write a program that prompts a user for numbers until the user enters 'done'. The program should print the mean of numbers, the min, the max and the standard deviation.

#### Constraints 
- Use loops and arrays to perform the input and mathematical operations
- Be sure to exclude 'done' entry from the array of inputs
- Keep the input seperate form the processing and the output
