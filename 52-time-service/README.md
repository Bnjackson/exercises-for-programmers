Create a simple web service that returns the correct time as JSON data. 
Then create a client application that connects to the web service, parses the response, and displays the time.

#### Constraints
- In your server application, be sure to set the content type to Application/JSON when you send the response. 
- Build the server app with as little code as possible.

#### Challengees
- Build another server that displays a random quote. Store quotes in an array and pick one at random.
