Create a program that determines how many years you have left until retirement, and the year in which you will retire. 
The program should prompt the user for their current age as well as the age they wish to retire.
The program will output how long until they can retire and year which they can retire.
- Program must check that user inputs are numbers
- Program must get current year using system time and not by hard-code
- Program must not ouput a negative number and must check if user can already retire
