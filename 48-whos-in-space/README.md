Create a program tah pulls data from an API that contains data on how many people are currently in space. Program should pull in this data and display it in tabular order.

#### Constraints 
- Read the data directly from the API and parse the results each time the program is run. Don’t download the data as text and read it in.
- Don’t repeat the name of the craft—group all people by craft.
- Can you reliably sort the results alphabetically by last name? Be careful—some people have spaces in their name, like “Mary Sue Van Pelt.”
